THIS PR...

- both bots have the id of the ballots
    - make shitbot add 📓 to front of first ballot message ✅
    - make shitbot add 📒 to front of second ballot message ✅
    - have readybot listen for those from shitbot and save the message ids somewhere
        - in db
    - migration that adds a ballot-info table to db ✅
    - api call to write to database ✅
    - tests 
    - api call to read from database
    - tests 
    - api client package, with contracts/structs used by api. 
        - lets you make calls to api. as simple functions. just do the ballot calls for now. 

we have to remove a emoji from the message. otherwise the extra one to label the message makes it break. ✅
and the delete command doesnt work. so fix that. ✅

ok. so. good points from chathew. workspaces.  ✅

update the readme (this goal should be in every goals.txt...)


PROD DEPLOY NOTES:
- delete node_modules and npm install at root
- delete emoji in prod

---------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURE WORK:

- we need to make auth a priority on the api side.
- shitbot and arbie should only listen/exist in their designated channel
- have both bots add nonzero emojis to each ballot. in a particular order
    - properbot will just add a dummy hello world poc one that does a console.log or something
    - shitbot adds the same emojis as usual, readybot adds ✔ and ✅ on both ballots, always second emoji and second last emoji
