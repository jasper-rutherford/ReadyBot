move shitbot into docker
    - delete data folder (... next update. separate pr)

think about how we get the spotify refresh token stuff started
- this is annoying. because right now it opens a webpage that i go to in a browser to log in. 
- ok actually I think *for now* its fine to still do the website thing. just expose the port in docker.
- I'd like to work towards a world where that's not a thing, and headless envs can do things nicer,
    but I think that's beyond the scope of what I want right here and now. 

DEPLOYMENT PROCESS TO RASPI:
- migrate postgres up. this should happen on `make start`
- run data migration script `sudo bash migratejsontopostgres.sh`
