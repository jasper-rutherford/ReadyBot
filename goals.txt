1. both bots have the id of the ballots
    - one sends both, reacts a special emoji to indicate which is which, and then the other
    hears that emoji and goes ok sweet that/those are the ballots. 
    - I think in the interest of touching shitbot as little as possible, lets leave the sending in shitbot. 
        - try to only edit shitbot such that it adds the signal emojis and waits for the readybot emojis

    - make shitbot add 📓 to front of first ballot message ✅
    - make shitbot add 📒 to front of second ballot message ✅
    - have readybot listen for those from shitbot and save the message ids somewhere
        - where? in memory 

2. have both bots add nonzero emojis to each ballot. in a particular order
    - properbot will just add a dummy hello world poc one that does a console.log or something
    - shitbot adds the same emojis as usual, readybot adds ✔ and ✅ on both ballots, always second emoji and second last emoji

update the readme (this goal should be in every goals.txt...)
