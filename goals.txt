update readme fool

create `POST scores` endpoint

test it

have shitbot call it

update the readme (this goal should be in every goals.txt...) 


ugh

so, the only time we call logscore it then immediately calls get score for that song/theme
so, i think we should pull the logic out of GET scores, and call it for GET scores and also as a response for POST scores. 

shitbot debugger dont work? why not? is it stupid?
shitbot aint hitting the api right. i suspect its not accessing api port correctly, or that localhost:3001 is wrong entirely.
